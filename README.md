# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

-  [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-  [Express js](https://expressjs.com/)
-  [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
-  [JWT](https://jwt.io/) 
-  [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/)
-  [Amazon s3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
-  [Render](https://render.com/)
